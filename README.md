# Project 2

I chose to put this on my portfolio as project 2 for a couple reasons.

1. This was the first time really working with React, which I fell in love with. I loved the minimalism you have at times in components, which is also mixed with a lot of possibility.

2. I used the React Bootstrap npm package. This was my first time employing mobile-first design.

3. Lastly, our cohort hadn't used APIs before this day and I was especially intrigued by the amount of data we had to sift through. Then we had to present it in a visual way, jumping into the world of Google APIs and how they can interact with what you're doing.


## Objectives

Developers will be able to:
- Use fetch to grab data from the USGS earthquakes API
- Use the Google Maps API to embed a map

## GeoQuakes

#### Deliverable

Our goal is to:
- List information about each quake.
- Display a Google Map with a pin at the epicenter of each quake.
